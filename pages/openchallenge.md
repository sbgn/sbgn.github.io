# Open Challenge
## The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge

The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge is an open project that aims at employing reusability and composability as design principles for assembling extensive Process Description maps and for enabling efficient large-scale collaborative efforts. We would like to progress through working with a specific example, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling, and develop clear guidelines for creating and managing map components.  

Specific objectives are:  
1. Develop a minimal set of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway variants that can be then reused in a composable manner for developing new maps.  
1. Describe potential issues that prevent reusability and composability.  
1. Offer clear guidelines and specific solutions for creating composable components and modularised maps that would consist of such components.
