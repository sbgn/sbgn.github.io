# Open Challenge
## The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge

### Description
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge is an open project that aims at employing reusability and composability as design principles for assembling extensive Process Description maps and for enabling efficient large-scale collaborative efforts. We would like to progress through working with a specific example, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling, and develop clear guidelines for creating and managing map components.  

### How to participate
We invite experts on the topic of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling and curators that are interested in working with the related literature and developing the most up-to-date version of this signalling cascade.  

### Objectives 
1. Develop a minimal set of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway variants that can be then reused in a composable manner for developing new maps.  
1. Describe potential issues that prevent reusability and composability.  
1. Offer clear guidelines and specific solutions for creating composable components and modularised maps that would consist of such components.  

### Analysis of the existing reconstructions of the pathway
In preparation for this challenge, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK components in the following resources have been analysed: the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network, the Ractome databases and PANTHER database [REF].
