# Open Challenge
## The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge

### Description
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge is an open project that aims at employing reusability and composability as design principles for assembling extensive Process Description maps and for enabling efficient large-scale collaborative efforts. We would like to progress through working with a specific example, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling, and develop the most up-to-date version of this signalling cascade so it can be used as a reference resource.  

In preparation for this challenge, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK components in the following resources have been analysed: the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network, the Ractome databases and PANTHER database [REF].  


### How to participate
We invite experts on the topic of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling and curators who are interested in working with the related literature and in representing the corresponding mechanisms of this signalling cascade.  

### Objectives 
1. Wile assimilating available versions of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, design a minimal set of pathway variants that can be then applied in a composable manner for developing new maps.  
1. Using the experience of developing this example, offer clear guidelines and specific solutions for creating composable components and modularised maps that would consist of such components.
