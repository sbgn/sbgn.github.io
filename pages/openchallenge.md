# Open Challenge
## The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge

### Description
The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge is an open project that aims at employing reusability and composability as design principles for assembling extensive Process Description maps and for enabling efficient large-scale collaborative efforts. We would like to progress through working with a specific example, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling, and develop the most up-to-date version of this signalling cascade so it can be used as a reference resource.  

In preparation for this challenge, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK components in the following resources have been analysed: the Atlas of Cancer Signalling Network, the Ractome databases and PANTHER database [REF].  


### How to participate
We invite experts on the topic of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling and curators that are interested in working with the related literature and in representing the corresponding mechanisms of this signalling cascade.  

### Objectives 
1. Develop a minimal set of RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway variants that can be then reused in a composable manner for developing new maps.  
1. Offer clear guidelines and specific solutions for creating and using composable components and modularised maps that would consist of such components.
