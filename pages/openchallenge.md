# Open Challenge
## The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge

The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK Pathway Challenge is an open project that aims at employing reusability and composability as design principles for assembling extensive Process Description maps and for enabling efficient large-scale collaborative efforts. The objective is to progress through working with a specific example, the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signalling, and develop clear guidelines for creating and managing map components.
