# SBGN Lab

The SBGN Lab was created to facilitate further development of the SBGN standard through experimenting with the SBGN languages and their applications. New ideas and solutions are very welcome. Please share your proposal with an example diagram as a PDF file by using the [sbgn-editors mailing list](mailto:sbgn-editors@googlegroups.com) or the [sbgn-discuss mailing list](mailto:sbgn-discuss@googlegroups.com).
