# SBGN Lab

The SBGN Lab was created to facilitate further development of the SBGN standard through experimenting with the SBGN languages and their applications. We welcome new ideas and solutions. Please share your proposal as a PDF file by using the [sbgn-editors mailing list](mailto:sbgn-editors@googlegroups.com) or the [sbgn-discuss mailing list](mailto:sbgn-discuss@googlegroups.com).
