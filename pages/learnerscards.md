# Learner's reference cards

The learner's reference cards are designed to provide an easy entry point to the SBGN languages. In contrast to the compact [SBGN reference cards](/referencecards), the learner's cards show how the elements of the language are applied. The learner's card do not offer all possible ways to apply the languages but can be used as a helpful material for learning the standard.
